          <h3>What is #mobbed?</h3>
          <p>#mobbed is a public database of incidents of mob violence reported by The Indian Express from  2010 onwards. We hope this database will lead us to discover indicative insights that add to our collective understanding of the culture of mob violence in India.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class="answer" id="why">
        <a class="anchorjs-link" href="#why"></a>
        <h3>Why #mobbed?</h3>
        <p>It is said that not everything that can be counted should be counted, and that not everything that counts can be counted. We believe this phrase neatly sums up the advantages and disadvantages of the quantitative approach. The public discourse thus far on mob violence is heavily qualitative, meaning that most of the discussion is sparked by media reports. We asked ourselves if counting all these instances and sifting through them would offer a more enriching narrative. The results, we believe, speak for themselves.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class="answer" id="options">
        <a class="anchorjs-link" href="#options"></a>
         <h3>Why are there two options to explore the data?</h3>
         <p>In the dataset, we offer two primary filters to explore the data: as a law & order issue and as a hate crime issue. Why? Because if the ‘left’ screams hate crime, the ‘right’ in India often parries back with law & order. In this polarised atmosphere, our primary aim is to investigate if the trends changed if we looked at the issue through the two filters. Here again, the results speak for themselves, as can be seen in the data. The Findings page also contains a short commentary.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class="answer" id="hate-crime">
        <a class="anchorjs-link" href="#hate-crime"></a>
          <h3>How have we defined mob violence and hate crimes?</h3>
          <p>We have defined mob violence as three or more people ganging up against one person or more. This includes vigilantism that is both about <span class="highlight">retributive justice (“he stole my bike”) and social control (“he is eating beef/they married out of caste”)</span>.</p>
          <p>We have defined hate crimes as offences motivated by hatred against an individual based on her race, religion, sexual orientation, gender, caste, ethnicity, or political affiliation. We have drawn from the definition of hate crime from the <a href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/bja/162304.pdf" target="_blank">U.S. Department of Justice</a> and modified it to suit the Indian context.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class="answer" id="included">
        <a class="anchorjs-link" href="#included"></a>
          <h3>Which incidents are included?</h3>
          <p>As we explained above, we have only included those crimes that are defined either as ‘mob violence’ and/or ‘hate crime’. Also, only stories reported by The Indian Express have been considered.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class="answer" id="excluded">
        <a class="anchorjs-link" href="#excluded"></a>
          <h3>Which incidents are not included?</h3>
          <p>We have not included cases that have been categorised as riots, protests, naxal violence, insurgency and stone pelting.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class="answer" id="difference">
        <a class="anchorjs-link" href="#difference"></a>
          <h3>How is this data project different from what exists already?</h3>
          <p>Public data projects on the issue have so far restricted themselves to cow vigilantism (<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2017/07/india-epidemic-mob-lynching-170706113733914.html" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="https://thewire.in/153091/storymap-lynchings-india-cow-slaughter-beef-ban-gau-rakshak/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://www.indiaspend.com/cover-story/86-dead-in-cow-related-violence-since-2010-are-muslim-97-attacks-after-2014-2014" target="_blank">here</a>) or <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/hate-tracker" target="_blank">hate crime</a>. Our goal is to be more comprehensive, and we have <span class="highlight">tried to go  beyond “what happened” to situate these incidents in their social, political and legal context.</span></p>
          <p>The variables that we are studying include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Police strength per population in states. states We’ve benchmarked the police-to-population ratio per state to the recommended ratio by United Nations.</li>
            <li>Whether prima facie, the mob attack seemed planned.</li>
            <li>Whether the police intervened.</li>
            <li>Whether the police intervention was able to prevent a possible death.</li>
            <li>Subordinate judges per population. The ratio of subordinate court judges (lower judiciary) to the population in states.</li>
            <li>Whether the lynching took place in an urban or a rural area.</li>
            <li>The political party to which the ruling chief minister of the state belonged when the incident was reported.</li>
            <li>Whether the incident was a hate crime. (Hate crime defined as violence arising from a bias against the gender/caste/religion/ethnicity/race/disability/sexual orientation and gender identity/political affiliation of the victim.)</li>
          </ul>

      <div class="answer" id="data-collection">
        <a class="anchorjs-link" href="#data-collection"></a>
          <h3>How did we collect the data?</h3>
          <p>The National Crimes Records Bureau (NCRB), which collects data on crime in India, does not record incidents of mob violence. Short of going through police records in every thana in India, the only way to track mob violence is to rely on media reports. </p>
          <p>We used MIT Media Cloud to scour through IndianExpress.com from 2010 until 2017 for <span class="highlight">first reports of mob violence</span>.  This gave us more than 1,00,000 results. We then ran a code to narrow this down to roughly 7,000 incidents, which we then manually sifted to arrive at more than 200 unique incidents. In several cases, we cross-referenced them with reports from other media organisations. <a href="data-dictionary.html">Read more on our data collection methodology</a>.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class="answer" id="numerical-analysis">
        <a class="anchorjs-link" href="#numerical-analysis"></a>

          <h3>What does the data indicate?</h3>
          <p>This is not a statistical or numerical analysis. Our endeavour is simply to collect and organise <span class="highlight">a representative sample of mob violence in India</span>. This includes vigilantism, lynchings, spontaneous disputes and hate crimes.</p>
          <p>We’re not making any definitive claims as to why lynchings and other forms of mob violence happen in India. Hopefully, <span class="highlight">you will draw your own conclusions as you explore, slice and dice the data using the filters we’ve provided</span>. However, in order for us the contextualise the data, we are using the following grading system:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>“Few” (0-20 percent of the cases)</li>
            <li>“Some” (21-40 percent of the cases)</li>
            <li>“Roughly half” (41-60 percent)</li>
            <li>“Many” (61-80 percent)</li>
            <li>“Most” (81-100 percent)</li>
          </ul>

      <div class="answer" id="limitations">
        <a class="anchorjs-link" href="#limitations"></a>
        <h3>What are the limitations of our approach?</h3>
          <p>This database is built on first reports  of incidents that appeared on IndianExpress.com. This approach was necessary since the government does not collect data on mob violence. Because of this approach, there are a few other limitations: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Several incidents, especially those reported in regional media, are not reflected in this database. </li>
            <li>
              Some data points collected may not be very precise:
              <ul>
                <li>Where the religious and caste identity of the victims and accused is not clear, we have relied on their names as a guide. For example, if a victim’s surname is ‘Rao’, we have  categorised her as a Hindu, despite knowing that a minority of ‘Raos’ can be Muslim too.)  </li>
                <li>In some other cases, because of lack of adequate information, we have stopped short of using the label ‘hate crime’.</li>
                <li>We’ve categorised whether the incident was urban or rural based on Google search. </li>
              </ul>
              </li>
          </ul>
