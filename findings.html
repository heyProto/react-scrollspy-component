          Note: Below are broad insights drawn from a work-in-progress, incomplete database, which is why we haven’t attempted to draw sweeping conclusions. Rather, our focus has been to underline patterns that can help us further our understanding. We’re using a qualitative grading scale in our discussion of the findings: ‘Few’ (0—20%), ‘Some’ (21—40%), ‘Roughly Half’ (41—60%), ‘Many’ (61—80%) and ‘Most’ (81—100%).

        <h3>Mob justice in India</h3>
        <p><b class="larger">A Summary of the findings:</b></p>
        <div class="answer" id="state_spread">
          <p>
            <b class="larger">Geographical spread:</b> Uttar Pradesh accounts for the maximum instances of mob violence, followed by New Delhi, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Maharashtra. On the other hand, Manipur, Himachal Pradesh, Goa, Chandigarh, Telangana and Nagaland witness the fewest number of incidents.
          </p>
          <p>
            More cases were reported from rural than urban areas. Mob-led violence provoked by disputes and altercations were more likely to have occurred in urban areas, whereas incidents related to suspicions of witchcraft and child-lifting were more likely to be reported from rural areas.
          </p>
          <p>
            One factor that seems to be consistent across geographies is cow-related violence, which has emerged as a major factor in the past two years.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="state_nature">
          <p>
            <b class="larger">Nature of crime:</b> While a few of these incidents (0-20% of the time) were the outcome of a mob deliberately keeping a watch for a ‘crime’ to unfold, some others (21-40%) appeared to have been the result of a planned conspiracy against the victim. In roughly half the cases, however, the violence seems to have been spontaneous.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="state_law">
          <p>
            <b class="larger" >Law and order capacity of the state:</b> Most (81—100% of the time) of the incidents were reported from areas where the police-to-population ratio was below that of levels recommended by the UN, and the judge-to-population ratio was below average. The data also bears out another pattern: the police and police intervened only in a few cases (0-20%) but where it did, the intervention seems to have prevented death.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="state_why">
          <p><b class="larger">Why it happened:</b>
            The most common reason for mob violence between 2014 and 2017 is cow protection with more attacks reported from rural than urban areas, even though the police to population ratio in urban areas is higher than in rural areas. Victims were attacked for reasons related to the possession or transportation of cows, or on suspicions of cow slaughter. Other times they were attacked while skinning the carcasses of dead cows. Muslims account for a disproportionate segment of victims in this category. Most such attacks were either planned or done by neighbourhood and cow protection watches. Roughly half such attacks were reported from states ruled by the BJP.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suspicion of theft and petty issues emerged as the second most common reason why people were attacked and (or) lynched. In the case of suspicion of theft, many cases were reported from urban areas compared to rural areas. Roughly half such cases were reported from New Delhi. Whereas in the case of petty issues, victims were attacked by mobs over an ongoing or past dispute that had not been resolved. These included petty causes such as an objection to the purchase of a product, a cat entering a neighbour’s house and fights that erupted over driving and road rage. Roughly half of these appeared to be spontaneous rather than planned.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two other patterns emerge from the data: urban areas were more likely to report mob lynchings related to petty issues and those related to suspicions over theft. A maximum number of cases were reported from New Delhi as compared to other states and Union Territories.
          </p>
          <p>
            A note on “Others”: This category relates to instances of racial and hate attacks, drug dealing, government officials being killed in the line of duty, activists being murdered etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Murder/Death: People were also attacked on allegations of murder as part of a retributive justice cycle. In these cases, there are often no clear patterns in terms of a rural/urban spread or whether they were planned, or spontaneous acts.

        <h3>Witch Hunting</h3>
        <p>
          The data reveals a few cases that were provoked by allegations of witchcraft. (Disclaimer: We did not search for “witchcraft” and our data lies at the intersections of mob violence and witch-hunting, hence, the reports in this section are not exhaustive).
        </p>
        <div class="answer" id="witch-hunting_why">
          <p>
            <b class="larger">Why this matters:</b> As Swati Parashar argues, “a combination of superstitious beliefs, religious practices and patriarchal norms unleashes lifelong suffering on women accused of witchcraft, in many cases resulting in their murders and lynchings... These stories are mostly passed over; the accused goes unpunished.”
          </p>

        <div class="answer" id="witch-hunting_where">
          <p>
            <b class="larger" >Where:</b> Most of these occurred in the eastern part of the country with roughly half being reported from Jharkhand. Most were reported from rural areas.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="witch-hunting_law">
          <p>
            <b class="larger">Law and Order:</b> Most of the states accounting for such incidents have a poor judge-to-population ratio, and often even the police-to-population ratio is below the UN recommendation of 230 per lakh people. The police intervened only in a few cases in our database but where it did, the intervention seems to have saved lives.

        <div class="answer" id="witch-hunting_what">
          <p>
            <b class="larger">What the NCRB data says:</b> Jharkhand, which accounts for the largest share of reported incidents of mob violence instigated by allegations of witchcraft, also records the maximum cases of murder due to witchcraft as reflected in data collected by the National Crime Records Bureau.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="witch-hunting_who">
          <p>
            <b class="larger">Who the victims are:</b> Roughly half the victims in the data are/were from tribal communities.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="witch-hunting_nature">
          <p>
            <b class="larger">Nature of crime:</b> Many of these cases were planned. Frequently, people were targeted if there had been a series of deaths, or if someone had developed an incurable illness. Decisions to lynch were often taken at the level of the community.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="witch-hunting_read-more">
          <p>
            <b class="larger">Read More:</b> For example, two women were lynched in Jharkhand because they were held responsible for two deaths that occurred in Bengaluru, Karnataka: (From an August 8, 2016 report):
          </p>
          <p>
            “Ram Pravesh, a resident of Sahiyara tola, had lost his son about a month ago. His son had gone to Bengaluru to take up some odd jobs. Three days ago, Ram Pravesh’s son-in-law, who too was in Bengaluru, died due to some reason. He and another associate began suspecting the two women of practicing witchcraft and to deal with the problem the villagers called a meeting on Sunday.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Witchcraft as cover-up: At least half of these instances appeared to be motivated by hate. Some reports found that accusations of witchcraft were made as a cover for something else, such as land disputes.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, it was learnt that behind the garb of superstition lay property dispute, family and personal rivalries. Rakiya’s son Johan said, “Our relatives Sachin and Sandeep had an eye on our land. They led the mob that dragged my mother and sister out and stripped them.”

            <b class="larger">Why it matters:</b> The reports in the data show that mobs attack people for different reasons, and ‘cow protection’ is one of them. However, cases under this category have surged since 2014, and have received much public attention.

            43-year-old Mohammed Hussain said he and his 38-year-old wife Naseema Bano were on way to their hometown in Harda after visiting an ailing relative in Hyderabad, when they were assaulted. “They pushed my wife around when she objected to our luggage being searched. We live in India and know what is wrong and right, we eat only goat meat. Besides, the black bag from which the meat was seized did not belong to us. Finally, a constable came to our rescue and saved my wife,” said Hussain.
